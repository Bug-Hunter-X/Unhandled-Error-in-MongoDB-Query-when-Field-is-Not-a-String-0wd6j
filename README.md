# MongoDB Query Error Handling
This example demonstrates how to handle errors that can occur when querying MongoDB, specifically when the field you are querying is not of the expected type (e.g., a string).  Improper handling can lead to unexpected crashes. The solution provides best practices to prevent this.  Please see `bug.js` for the buggy code and `bugSolution.js` for the solution.
